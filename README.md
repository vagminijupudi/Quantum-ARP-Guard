The rise of network-based attacks, particularly ARP spoofing, presents a formidable challenge to the security of modern communication networks. Conventional cryptographic methods have struggled to withstand increasingly sophisticated attacks, prompting the exploration of alternative security paradigms. This project introduces a groundbreaking approach to ARP spoof detection by leveraging the principles of quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to establish communication channels inherently resistant to eavesdropping and tampering. By exploiting quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, quantum cryptographic protocols offer unprecedented security assurances. In this project, we propose integrating quantum cryptographic techniques into ARP spoof detection and mitigation. The system operates by employing quantum key distribution (QKD) and integrating it with the BB84 protocol to establish secure communication channels between network devices. QKD protocols ensure the exchange of encryption keys with provable security guarantees, thwarting eavesdropping attempts by malicious actors. By incorporating QKD into ARP communication processes, the system authenticates the identity of communicating devices with quantum-secure keys, mitigating the risk of ARP spoofing attacks. Furthermore, using the BB84 protocol, random secret keys are transmitted by encoding them in the polarization of photons. The no-cloning theorem ensures that an eavesdropper cannot measure these photons and transmit them without disturbing their state in a detectable way, enhancing security. The proposed ARP spoof detection system undergoes rigorous evaluation through extensive simulations and real-world experiments. Comparative analysis with traditional cryptographic approaches demonstrates the superior resilience of quantum-based solutions against ARP spoofing attacks. Additionally, the scalability and practical feasibility of implementing quantum cryptography in network security infrastructures are assessed, highlighting potential widespread adoption in enterprise and critical infrastructure environments. By integrating quantum cryptography into ARP spoof detection mechanisms, this project offers a groundbreaking advancement in network security. Leveraging the inherent security properties of quantum physics, such as the encrypted protection of transmitted photons, the proposed system provides robust protection against ARP spoofing attacks, thereby enhancing the resilience of modern network infrastructures.
